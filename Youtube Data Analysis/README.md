In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns
in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective 
communication.

This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it includes a bunch of information for videos that were trending for at least one day. This data set will require some 
cleaning in excel prior to Tableau. You can find the dataset in supporting materials at the bottom of this page.
